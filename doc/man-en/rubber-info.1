.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rubber-info
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ action ]
.I source

.SH DESCRIPTION
Rubber-info is a utility for extracting various kinds of information from a
LaTeX document. Information can be extracted from the source (for instance
when calculating dependencies) or from the compilation log files (to extract
errors and warnings). This program is a complement for the compilation system
.BR rubber (1).

The command-line options are those used by
.BR rubber (1)
plus one of the actions described below.

.SH ACTIONS
One of the following command-line options must be specified, to decide which
information to extract. Of course, for actions that read a log file, a
compilation must have been done before. If none of these actions is specified,
.I \-\-check
is assumed.
.TP
.B \-\-boxes
Extracts from the log file the places in the source where bad boxes appeared
(these are the famous overfull and underfull \\hbox and \\vbox)
.TP
.B \-\-check
Report errors if there are any, otherwise report undefined references if there
are any, otherwise list warnings and bad boxes. This is the default action.
.TP
.B \-\-deps
Analyse the source files and produce a space-separated list of all the files
that the document depends on and that Rubber cannot rebuild.
.TP
.B \-\-errors
Extract from the log file the list of errors that occured during the last
compilation.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display the list of all available options and exit nicely.
.TP
.B \-\-refs
Report the list of undefined or multiply defined references (i.e. the \\ref's
that are not defined by one \\label).
.TP
.B \-\-rules
Analyse the source files and produce a list of dependency rules. One rule is
produced for each intermediate target that would be made when running
.BR rubber .
Rules are formatted in the style of Makefiles.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version number and exit nicely.
.TP
.B \-\-warnings
Stupidly enumerate all LaTeX warnings, i.e. all the lines in the log file that
contain the string "Warning".
